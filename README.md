# reading-circle
This is a repository for content that our community generates during our monthly reading circles

Please attend one of our [Applied AI Meetups](https://appliedai.mn) and learn about the community.

Each month we are planning to do reading circles where we discuss articles we find on the internet with others in a small (10-person) group setting. The notes, articles, and other resources will be included here.
